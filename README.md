# Docker Wordpress LAMP Stack with Traefik revese proxy.
Bitnami Wordpress stack with MariaDB, Portainer, Netdata, and Traefik

## Motivation

- host each service as a subdomain of a personal domain with letsencrypt
- run public maintained images with no modifications
- require minimal configuration and setup

## Features

- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) is the definitive open source container management GUI for Kubernetes, Docker, Swarm and ACI.
- [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the easiest way to create a free website or blog. It's a powerful hosting platform that grows with you.
- [Maria](https://mariadb.org/) Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. It's made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source.
- [Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) - Troubleshoot slowdowns and anomalies in your infrastructure with thousands of metrics, interactive visualizations, and insightful health alarms.

## Initial Steps
Prepare your compose folder and git clone the repo.
```
mkdir -p $HOME/docker
```
```
cd $HOME/docker
```
```
git clone https://github.com/slochewie/traefik-lamp.git
```
```
cd $HOME/docker/traefik-lamp
```

## Direct Configuration option
- No Traefik reverse proxy or autogenerated Let's Encrypt SSL certs.
- Use for non Internet facing sites.

Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and populate all fields in the `COMMON` section.
```
cp env.sample .env
```

Create a link in order to append `docker-compose.direct.yml` to future docker-compose commands.

```bash
ln -sf docker-compose.direct.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

Review the merged configs by running `docker-compose config`.

## Letsencrypt Configuration option
-Traefik revese proxy with autogenerated Let's Encrypt SSL certs.
- Use for secure Internet facing sites.

Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and populate all fields in the `COMMON` and `LETSENCRYPT` sections.

Create a link in order to append `docker-compose.letsencrypt.yml` to future docker-compose commands.

```bash
ln -sf docker-compose.letsencrypt.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

Review the merged configs by running `docker-compose config`.

## Acknowledgments

I didn't create any of these docker images myself, so credit goes to the
maintainers, and the original software creators.
